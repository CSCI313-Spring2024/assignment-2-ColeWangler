        <p style="text-indent: 50px; line-height: 1.9;">Hello! My name is Cole Wangler. I am currently double majoring in software and computer engineering at NDSU. It is currently my second
        year at NDSU and I have really been enjoying it. After graduating I have plans to get a carreer as a <u>embedded systems engineer.</u> With my subset being
        geared towards <u>embedded software.</u> I believe it is important to get a good theoretical mindset behind computer science to understand the code 
        and then learn how to apply engineering principles to effectively create software systems. My ideal job would be working in the RND section of a company
        so then I can create new devices that will help people.
        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px; line-height: 1.9;">I grew up in a small agricultural town Madison, Minnesota. I got interested into the stem field when I joined
        my highschool FIRST Robotics team. When I was about 14 I researched and built my own computer which is why I decided computer engineering would
        be a good fit for me. I didnt know how much I enjoyed coding until I started taking my computer science courses at college. This is when I decided I wanted to become an
        engineer but still work with software. I am now currently looking for chances to get industry experience.

            <p>The inspiration behind coding lies in the boundless realm of creativity and problem-solving. 
              The ability to transform abstract concepts into tangible, functional programs is a testament to the 
              power of human ingenuity. Beyond the tangible outcomes, coding fosters a mindset of continual learning and 
              adaptability, as technology evolves rapidly. The constant challenge of overcoming obstacles, unraveling complex puzzles, and contributing to the ever-expanding 
              digital landscape serves as a perpetual wellspring of inspiration for those immersed in the world of coding.</p>
